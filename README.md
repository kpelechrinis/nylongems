# nylongems

The ```Flask``` directory includes the code for the nylongems site (http://nylongems.pythonanywhere.com), while the ```bt-nylongems``` script analyzes the data using the Bradley-Terry model.

The flask app is written as simple as possible to enable people without deep knowledge of database to generate similar sites. A more robust implementation would include a backend database to store the data (instead of a log-file).
